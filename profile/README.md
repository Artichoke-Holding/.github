# Artichoke Group

We are a team of innovators committed to developing impactful solutions for contemporary global challenges.

## About us

Founded in 2019, Artichoke has experienced significant growth and evolution over the past few years. Initially, our objective was to provide server capacities for the innovative Threefold project, which aimed to establish a decentralized internet. However, with the onset of the pandemic, we promptly redirected our focus.
In an effort to contribute meaningfully during the crisis, our team dedicated extensive effort and resources to establish the capability for conducting PCR testing in compact, containerized units. This initiative quickly positioned us as the third-largest provider of COVID-19 testing services in Austria, reaching a peak capacity of approximately 250,000 tests per day.
Now, as the pandemic has subsided, Artichoke is realigning its focus towards other promising areas where we can provide valuable assistance and support.
